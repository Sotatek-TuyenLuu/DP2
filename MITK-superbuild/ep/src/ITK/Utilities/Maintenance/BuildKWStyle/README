This directory contains the skeleton CMakeLists.txt to download, build
and install KWStyle. It is implemented in two parts:

1. CMakeLists.txt, which has a recipe to build KWStyle using the
CMake ExternalProject module.

2. BuildKWStyle.sh, which is a script which automate the whole
process.

This only works on Unix and OS X; to build KWStyle on Windows,
you can still use the CMakeLists.txt, but you'll have to configure and
build yourself, since Windows lacks a Bourne SHell.

THE SCRIPT

Usage: BuildKWStyle.sh [build-directory] [install-prefix]

You must specify a directory in which to build KWStyle, and the
prefix path where you wish to have it installed.

Once you've built and installed KWStyle, to use it in ITK, you must
set KWStyle_DIR to ${install-prefix}/lib/KWStyle.  For example

BuildKWStyle.sh /scratch/KWStyle /opt/KWStyle
export PATH="/opt/KWStyle/bin:${PATH}"

KWStyle is needed for the git hooks that enforce ITK Code Style
guidelines, so it's best to build KWStyle before trying to check in
source to the ITK Tree.
